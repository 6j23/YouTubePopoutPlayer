## Installation
1. Instal [Greasemonkey](//addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) for Firefox or [Tampermonkey](//chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) for Chrome

3. Follow the displayed instructions from Greasemonkey or Tampermonkey to finish the installation

## Features
* The YouTube HTML5 player is automatically paused when clicking opening the popout player
* The popout player window is automatically sized to match the HTML5 player (normal vs. theater mode)
* The popout player window can be freely resized and the video will not be obscured
* The popout player will continue playing the video from the current position automatically

## Known Issues - To Be Fixed ASAP
* ~~If you navigate to a video from the YouTube homepage, search results, or from another YouTube video, the Popout link will NOT appear~~ **Fixed in v1.1**
* The script does not work with the [YouTube Gaming](//gaming.youtube.com/) interface (or probably any other alternate interface)
